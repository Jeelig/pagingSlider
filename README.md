# pagingSlider
=======================

## Notice
Inspired by http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/03/hardware-accelerated-page-transitions-for-mobile-web-apps-phonegap-apps/ 
I have written an extension. This extension allows the page slider to control several pages away, 
retrieve individual pages and sliden from one side to another.


## Features

- slide to pages with touch swipes
- auto switch to pages by clicking menu item
